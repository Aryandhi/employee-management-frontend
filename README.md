# EmployeeManagementFrontend

Mini project about Employee Management Data.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

## Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you have to be familiar with the following tools:

- Angular 15 and its core concepts, like components, templates, services, and modules.
- Material UI
- NodeJS and Typescript
- Visual Studio Code (optional)
- Angular CLI and JSON Server.

## Development server
Let's play the application if this app is working perfectly by typing the following command:
`ng serve -o`
This command will redirect you to http://localhost:4200

Now open another terminal tab or split the terminal in VSCode then start the json-server via the following command:
`json-server --watch 'db.json'`
This command will locally start a server at port 3000 where we will send our requests for creating, reading, updating, and deleting an employee.
